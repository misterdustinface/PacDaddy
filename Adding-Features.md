## Adding Features

- Create a directory named "features" local to the PacDaddyEngine.jar
- Add lua files to the directory named "features"
- The lua files in the features folder will be loaded at runtime
- The lua files can access a global object named APPLICATION, which is a reference to an instance of the PacDaddyGame
