## Adding Features

1. Create a directory named "features" local to the PacDaddyEngine.jar
2. Add lua files to the directory named "features"
3. The lua files in the features folder will be loaded at runtime

### Features in Lua
  - Features can access a global lua variable named APPLICATION, which is a reference to the PacDaddyGame
