## Adding Features

1. Create a directory named "features" local to the PacDaddyEngine.jar
2. Add lua files to the directory named "features"
3. The lua files in the features folder will be loaded at runtime

### Features in Lua
  - [FeatureLoader README](https://github.com/misterdustinface/FeatureLoader/blob/master/README.md)
  - APPLICATION is a reference to the PacDaddyGame
  - The lua file Features can access any public method of the PacDaddyGame through this APPLICATION reference
